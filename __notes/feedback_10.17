Feedback:

-When y caliper moves down, everything on the view gets realistically bigger (scale x/y, slide down).
-Create a side view of the scope and put it at the side of the front-view so there are two views active simultaneously.
-Create 8 SVG views of the lenses. 4 for fixed pivots, 4 for intermission pivots. Add drag functionality at top of lense (Warning to not touch lenses)
    -Modify SVG files to represent orientation of the scope better.
-Modify setup stage to include:
    -Place slide in.
    -Toggle aperture light.
    -Control calipers to make sure specimen is under the aperture light (Perhaps popup view to show specimen orientation). 
-Aperture knob light should increase as magnification increases
    -Low mag should have very low light.
    -High mag should have higher aperture value (more diffraction).
    -Change orientation of aperture knob to rightmost side.
-Consider the use of event targets as opposed to hardcoded div names.
-Utilize bindings over setTimeout if possible.
-Slide view should change by state changes.
