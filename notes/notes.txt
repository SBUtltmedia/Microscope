Intro
- Light Switch
- Condenser:		y-axis diaphragm— should always be at the top

red lens	aperture lowest good

initial state:	
	- light off
	- stage down
	- condenser down
	- slide off
	- lens that is not red


low mag/high mag	->		low/medium/high

**calibrate views
** overexposure
__ aperture- start closed

linear:
	> turn on light
	> condenser up— scale
	> slide on
	> caliper (x, y)
--- end set up

	> lenses- lowmag
	> coarse

	** cannot set diopter on low mag **
	yellow:
	> change lens
	> fine
	> diopter
	> ocular (note: don’t set on low)
	
	blue:
	> change lens
	> aperture — max
	> fine

	-> Game
	1. change slide
		> rotate red (not through white)
		> lower stage
		> reduce light
		> remove slide
		> add new slide
			> caliper (x,y)
			> coarse
			> rotate medium
			> fine
			> rotate to high
			> open aperture
			> fine
	

	2. 	 troubleshooting (fix the scope)
		> 

	3. clean scope
		> lens paper / windex

	4. field of view (measuring)
		> low mag
			> place ruler
			> caliper
		> high mag
		
	5. depth of focus
		>

	6. Orientation (e-slide)
		> 

	* warning: don’t go to oil *


--Fixed--
-Fine tuning values of microcsope to be as realistic as possible
-Responsive design when reduced
-Aperture precision not implemented yet.

-- Known Bugs/Fixes --
-Rotation not firefox compatible.
-Modify Coarse Knob to complete on clarity (white line).
-Add warnings/additional text
    -Too high of aperture light will be blinding (on low mag)
    -Too far movement of knobs may blur view. 
-Implement game modes (restriction to restrictionless)
-Deviate from framework and add a feedback button before moving forward.
-Readjust position of popup as it goes step by step
-Rewrite the popup text (directions) to be more brief.
-Play with timing of popup movement.
-Adjust slide so that it triggers its activation on top of pseudoclone.
-Play with the possibility of moving the guiding text over to the side steps (toggability).
-Overflow x on popup box.
